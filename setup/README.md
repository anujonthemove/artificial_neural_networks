# Setup and Installation

This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the installation of the necessary libraries and how to setup your environment, in order to run the various code examples.

The code should run on any machine (i.e. Windows, macOS, Linux) that supports Python 3.

Note: It is possible that the code might work with Python 2, either as is or with a few modifications. However, this repository does not support Python 2.

## Quick installation

If, for any reason, you want to spend the minimum amount of time for setting up your environment, then you can follow the steps below.

### 1. Install Python 3

In order to save a lot of trouble, download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which is actively supported by the Data Science community.

Go to the [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) page and choose the installation for either [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows), [macOS](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) or [Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) accordingly.

The Anaconda Distribution also includes the [SPYDER](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) IDE, which is the one that was used for writting the code examples in this repository. This IDE is considered to be ideal for Machine Learning, Data Science and Scientific Computing.

### 2. Install the required packages
