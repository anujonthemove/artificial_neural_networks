# artificial_neural_networks
This repository contains a collection of Methods and Models for various architectures of Artificial Neural Networkis.

Currently it includes the following architectures:

* [Feedforward Neural Network](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/architectures/feedforward_neural_networks)
  * Standard Neural Networks
* [Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/architectures/recurrent_neural_networks)
  * GRU
  * LSTM
  * Vanilla RNN

It also includes applications in several domains:

- [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/applications/bioinformatics)
- [Computational Finance](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/applications/computational_finance)
- [Computer Vision](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/applications/computer_vision)
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/applications/natural_language_processing)
- [Speech Processing](https://github.com/kourouklides/artificial_neural_networks/tree/master/code/applications/speech_processing)

The code implementation is in Python (using TensorFlow and Keras libraries).
