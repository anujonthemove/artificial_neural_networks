# artificial_neural_networks
This repository contains a collection of Methods and Models for various architectures of Artificial Neural Networks.

The code implementation is in Python (using TensorFlow and Keras libraries).

Currently, it includes the following architectures:

- [Feedforward Neural Network](code/architectures/feedforward_neural_networks)
  - Bayesian Neural Networks
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
  - [Standard Neural Networks](code/architectures/feedforward_neural_networks/standard_neural_networks)
- [Recurrent Neural Network](code/architectures/recurrent_neural_networks)
  - GRU
  - LSTM
  - Vanilla RNN

It also includes applications in several domains:

- [Bioinformatics](code/applications/bioinformatics)
- [Computational Finance](code/applications/computational_finance)
- [Computer Vision](code/applications/computer_vision)
- [Natural Language Processing](code/applications/natural_language_processing)
- [Speech Processing](code/applications/speech_processing)

Some advanced Methods of Machine Learning are also included:

- Ensemble Learning
- Transfer Learning
