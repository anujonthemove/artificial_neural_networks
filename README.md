# artificial_neural_networks
This repository contains a collection of Methods and Models for various architectures of Artificial Neural Networks.

The code implementation is in Python (using [TensorFlow]() and [Keras]() libraries).

Note: Hyperparameter Optimization, Model Selection and Model Evaluation are outside the scope of this repository.

## Introduction

* Currently, this repository is neither a library nor a framework, but it is a collection of code examples
* The source code is well documented so that it can be used for both educational purposes and for real-life applications
* This repository is intended to be friendly to beginners, but it is not limited just to them
* Since TensorFlow is ideal for both Research and Production Development, then so is this repository
* In order to deploy the source code into Production, a few extensions will have to be made first
* The [license](LICENSE) of this code essentially allows you to do whatever you want with the code

## Downloading
It is strongly recommended that you download the whole GitHub repository, but you can also try to download just the individual Python files and see if they work. However, there is no guarantee that individual files will work on their own.

To download the whole repository, there are currently two mains options:
* Clone the repository using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or using the [command line (terminal)](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
* Download the respository as a ZIP file

You can choose the one which you consider best for you. People who are experienced with Software Development will go for the first option most probably.

## Setup and Installation
The code should run on any machine (i.e. Windows, macOS, Linux) that supports Python 3.

Guides and instructions on how to install the necessary libraries and how to setup your environment can be found [here](setup/README.md).

## Models and Methods 
This repository includes the following architectures:

- [Feedforward Neural Network](code/architectures/feedforward_neural_networks)
