# artificial_neural_networks
This repository contains a collection of Methods and Models for various architectures of Artificial Neural Networks.

The code implementation is in Python (using [TensorFlow]() and [Keras]() libraries).

Note: Hyperparameter Optimization, Model Selection and Model Evaluation are outside the scope of this repository.

## Introduction

* Currently, this repository is neither a library nor a framework, but it is a collection of code examples
* These code examples are intended to be friendly to beginners, but they are also intended to be used for Research purposes
* Since TensorFlow is ideal for both Research and Production Development, then so is this repository
* The source code is well documented so that it can be used for both educational purposes and for real-life applications
* In order to deploy the source code into Production, a few extensions will have to be made first
* The [license](LICENSE) of this code essentially allows you to do whatever you want with the code
